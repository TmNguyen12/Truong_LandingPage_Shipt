# Design Decisions

- Responsive Design 
  - Media queries were based off of the way the content appeared on screen
    - this minimizes the need to add media queries for every device size
- Font choice 
  - defaulted to Scandia Regular
  - Sometimes, the design documents listed Scandia as the font but displayed Helvetica
  - If the design documents requested Scandia-Bold but that choice didn't flow well with the overall appearance, I chose to use Scandia-Regular and add font-weight
- In a production environment, all of these choices would be discussed with the designer in a collaborative fashion
